# Using State in Jetpack Compose Codelab

This folder contains the source code for the [Using State in Jetpack Compose codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-state).


In this codelab, you will explore patterns for working with state in a declarative world by building a Todo application. We'll see what unidirectional
data flow is, and how to apply it in a Jetpack Compose application to build stateless and stateful composables.
