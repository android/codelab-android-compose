# Jetpack Compose Theming Codelab

This folder contains the source code for the [Jetpack Compose Theming codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-theming).

In this codelab you will learn how to use [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)’s theming APIs to style your application. We’ll see how to customize colors, shapes and typography so that they’re used consistently throughout your application, supporting multiple themes such as light & dark theme.
